# liliput_step

This is childhood game that I used to play with friends outside. 
I decided to solve one of problem which fair game. 

This game has a host who tells who and what kind steps 
and how many steps the player has to do. 
There should be more than two players.
There is start and finish. 
The first person reaches finish wins.

The host usually was biased because of person,
that kind of predicted the outcome of the game.

This program is based on random numbers that give the input for program.
The program is still raw because 
it can have more modification 
and features to the game itself
because the game is too simple.
